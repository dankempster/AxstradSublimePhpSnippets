<!--
Create getter and setter methods for a string property.

=== How to Use ===
    php-strgetset<TAB><name of your property without a $ sign>

For example, if your property is called $name, you would go into your class, and type:
    php-strgetset<TAB>name

Then getName() and setName() will be created for you.

After the property name you can continue to <TAB> to set the following (in order)
    - getter/setter description, defaults to "(Get|Set) <name of your property without a $ sign>"
    - getter return and setter param description
    - name of class methods belong too for returns self, defaults to Self
